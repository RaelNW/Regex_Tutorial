## Regex Components

### Anchors

/^ is the starting anchor that asserts the start of the string. The $/ is the end of the string anchor that asserts the end of the string.

### Quantifiers

The quantifier in this regex includes the + operator which means one or more
of the characters preceding the quantifier is allowed in this context [a-z0-9_.-]+ one or more of the lower case letter, digit, underscore, dot and hyphen is allowed. The other quantifier is the {2,6} which indicates that the email address should contain 2 and 6 lowercase letters and dots.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are used to capture and extract specific parts of the email address.

- Group 1: ([a-z0-9_\.-]+)
  This part captures the username part of the email address.
- Group 2: ([\da-z\.-]+)
  This part captures the domain name part of the email address.
- Group 3: ([a-z\.]{2,6})
  This part captures the top level part of the domain (TLD) part of the email address. It matches the lowercase letters and dots with a length between 2-3 characters

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to define a set of characters.

- [a-z0-9_\.-] The first part a-z matches the lowercase letter, 0-9 digits, \_\.- underscores, dots and hyphens.
- [\da-z\.-] The character class matches lowercase letters, dots and hyphens.
- [a-z\.] this matches any lower case letters and literal dot.

### Character Classes

\d matches any digits, it is a shorthand character class that represents a single digit. It is equivalent to the character range [0-9]

### Character Escapes

\. Here the `\` character Escapes the dot character, allowing it to match a literal dot.
